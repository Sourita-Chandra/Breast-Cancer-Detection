# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Overview
This project focuses on predicting breast cancer using machine learning. It classifies tumors as benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on medical diagnostic features. The dataset includes attributes like tumor size, texture, and cell characteristics to aid classification.

 Machine Learning Models Used
We trained and evaluated the following models:
✔ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
✔ Logistic Regression
✔ Random Forest Classifier
✔ Gradient Boosting & XGBoost
✔ Naive Bayes & Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
✔ TPOT Classifier (AutoML)

 Performance Evaluation
Models were assessed using:
- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- 10-Fold Cross Validation

Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost provided the highest accuracy.

 Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, TPOT
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

Key Findings
Feature selection impacts model accuracy.
Ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost) performed best.
Cross-validation ensured robust model evaluation.
